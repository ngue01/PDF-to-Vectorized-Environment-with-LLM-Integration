Subject: Application for the internship on clock synchronization in WBAN sensor networks

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am currently a second-year Master's student in Intelligent Systems and Multimedia, pursuing a dual degree between the National University of Vietnam and the University of La Rochelle in France. I would like to submit my application for the internship you are offering on the study of clock synchronization in Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) sensor networks.

My academic background and experiences have allowed me to develop expertise in IoT systems, sensor management, and communication gateway development. During my studies, I have had the opportunity to participate in several projects, including at the Research Institute for Development (IRD) in Laos, where I am currently doing an internship. This internship focuses on the integration and configuration of sensors to measure temperature, air and soil humidity, as well as CO2 emissions. I have also worked on the creation of Raspberry Pi gateways with LoRa technology and the adaptation of firmware in the Arduino environment using C/C++.

I am particularly interested in your project, as it perfectly aligns with my current work on real-time data transmission and the management of possible disturbances in complex environments. Indeed, in Laos, I am already working on similar issues related to long-distance communication between sensors and implementing low-cost solutions for environmental data collection. This internship would represent a unique opportunity for me to apply my skills in a new setting and further develop my expertise on clock synchronization, which is particularly important in wireless sensor networks. It would also allow me to complete my master's program and pursue a Ph.D. opportunity.

I am confident that my skills in C/C++, sensor networks, and LoRa and WBAN technologies will be an asset to your team. I look forward to discussing my application and contributing to the success of your projects.

Yours sincerely,

NGUEMDJOM Kevin
