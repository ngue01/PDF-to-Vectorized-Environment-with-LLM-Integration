Resumption of the session

I declare the resumption of the session of the European Parliament, which was interrupted on Friday, December 17th, and I extend my best wishes to all of you, hoping that you had a pleasant holiday.

As you may have noticed, the major "Y2K bug" did not occur. However, citizens in a number of our countries have been victims of natural disasters that have truly been terrible. You have requested a debate on this matter in the coming days, during this session period.

In the meantime, I would like, as a number of colleagues have asked me, for us to observe a minute of silence for all the victims, particularly of the storms, in the various countries of the European Union that have been affected. I invite you to stand for this minute of silence.

(The Parliament stands and observes a minute of silence.)
